Description: This program allows the user to store students and staff members in a file with the use of an easy-to-use graphical user interface.

Hi! This is a little project of mine to show off some of the python skills I learned in CSCI-1620 "INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE II," 
instructed by Agatha Owora at the University of Nebraska at Omaha in Spring 2021.

P.S. 
The records.csv file must be in the same folder/directory as main.py and gui.py to successfully append the student records.
